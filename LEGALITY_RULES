# LEGALITY RULES

This document defines move, item, and team legality based on in-game progression.

## Gating Rules

- Badge Count:
  - TMs and opponents are gated by the number of badges obtained.
  - Refer to `tm-locations.txt` to determine which TMs are unlocked per badge.

- Level Cap:
  - A Pokémon can only use moves learned by or below the current level cap.

## Move Legality Source Hierarchy

1. `speciesData.js` – Level-up, egg, tutor moves
2. `tm-locations.txt` – TM availability (requires badge)
3. `moves.js` – Move definitions (e.g. PP, power, type)

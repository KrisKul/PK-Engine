# MOVESET LOOKUP

This document outlines the logic used to determine a Pok√©mon's legal moveset based on badge and level constraints.

## Lookup Steps

1. Find the species in `speciesData.js`.
2. Apply level filtering:
   - Only include level-up or tutor moves that are at or below the current level cap.
3. Check for TM access:
   - Only include TM moves that are unlocked at or below the current badge count, based on `tm-locations.txt`.
4. Exclude any move not learned via one of the above methods or not yet available under the badge/level constraints.

# TRAINER COUNTERING

This document defines how counterteams should be legally built against any given in-game trainer.

## Counterteam Generation

1. Load the trainer's full roster from `trainer-battles.txt`.
2. Evaluate weaknesses:
   - Identify primary type vulnerabilities, lack of coverage, and shared weaknesses.
3. Build a legal team of up to 6 Pokémon:
   - All Pokémon must be legal under the current badge and level cap rules.
   - Moves must follow legality rules outlined in `LEGALITY_RULES.md`.

## Optional Constraints

- Monotype: Restrict all selected Pokémon to a single shared type.
- TM Limit: Respect badge-based gating on TMs.
